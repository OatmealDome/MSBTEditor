# MSBTEditor
An editor for MSBT files used by modern Nintendo games. (It doesn't actually edit MSBT files yet, but it can read simple MSBT files. It breaks on more complex ones, see the TODOs in MSBTReader.java.) Command line functionality coming soon.
 
## Building
Run "clean install" with maven to build an executable .jar file.
